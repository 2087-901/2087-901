<h2 class="basic"> What is Green Energy? </h2>
<p class="basic" > Refers to the technologies that provide the greatest 
environmental benefit and it is defined as electricity generated from 
renewable resources, sources that are able to be restored in a short 
period of time and not diminish.
<h2 class="basic"> Why Implement Green Energy into Homes? </h2>
<p class="basic"> Most homes rely on nonrenewable energy sources like natural gas, oil, and coal. 
By eliminating fossil fuels in homes, there is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
and air pollution. Also better for our health.
A ground-breaking study by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL) explored the feasibility of generating 80 percent 
of the country’s electricity from renewable sources by 2050. They found that 
renewable energy could help reduce the electricity sector’s emissions by approximately 
81 percent. It will allow people to be less dependent on imported fuels. 
In recent years, renewable energy has become relatively cheaper than nonrenewable 
energy and it is even more affordable due to the subsidies set out by the government.
<h2 class="basic">What are the Different Types of Green Energy Sources? </h2>
<h3 class="basic">~SOLAR~</h3>
<p class="basic">
Solar energy is from the sun and is converted into thermal or electrical energy. 
It’s one of the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy sources available. 
The most widely known application are rooftop solar panels. Solar technologies convert
 sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels or through mirrors 
 that concentrate solar radiation. This energy can be used to generate electricity or be 
 stored in batteries or thermal storage. This energy can be used for all the electrical uses
 in the home and also to heat water. Most commercially produced solar panels have an efficiency 
 of about 20%. Not all the sunlight that reaches the solar panels is converted into electricity 
 and it can be a variety of factors such as temperature, wavelength, and reflection. 
 </p>
<h3 class="basic">~HYDRO~</h3>
<p class="basic">
Hydropower is one of the oldest and largest sources of renewable energy. 
It uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity. The greater the flow
 and the higher the head, the more the electricity that can be generated. It works by 
 water flowing through a pipe—also known as a penstock—and then spins the blades in a 
 turbine, which, in turn, spins a generator that ultimately produces electricity.
</p>

<h3 class="basic">~GEOTHERMAL~</h3>
<p class="basic">
Geothermal uses the heat energy from the earth.  
Resources come from reservoirs of hot water or human made at varying temperatures
 and depths below the earth's surface. Wells, ranging from a few feet to several miles 
 deep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that 
 can be brought to the surface for use. 
</p>

<h3 class="basic">~WIND~</h3>
<p class="basic">
Wind energy harnesses the power of wind. 
Wind energy is actually a byproduct of the sun. The sun’s uneven heating 
of the atmosphere, the earth’s irregular surfaces (mountains and valleys), 
and the planet's revolution around the sun all combine to create wind. Since 
wind is in plentiful supply, it’s a sustainable resource for as long as the sun’s 
rays heat the planet. The most popular technology used to harness wind are wind turbines.
 The propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator,
 which creates electricity.
</p>
<h2 class="basic"> Cost of Renewable VS Nonrenewable Energy</h2>
<p class="basic">
Resources from nature are abundant, as a result, 
they are relatively cheaper than the high demand and depleting supply 
of nonrenewable energy. While installation costs can be expensive, there
 are tax credits and incentives. Plus you won’t have to pay your monthly electricity bill.
</p>
<h2 class="basic">Why is Energy Efficiency Important?</h2>
<p class="basic">
Energy efficiency is the use of less energy to perform the same task or produce the same result.
Energy-efficient homes and build0ngs use less energy to heat, cool, and run appliances and
 electronics, and energy-efficient manufacturing facilities use less energy to produce goods.
It is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change, 
reduce energy costs for consumers, and improve the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. 
It’s also a vital component in achieving net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide through decarbonization.
</p>
<h2 class="basic"> Advantages of Green Energy </h2>
<p class="basic"> Resources will never run out, doesn’t harm the planet, low maintenance, and low operating costs.
</p>
<h2 class="basic"> Disadvantages of Green Energy</h2>
<p class="basic"> Unreliable weather can reduce efficiency. Solar needs clear skies and sun, wind turbines need wind, and hydro needs steady supply of water.
